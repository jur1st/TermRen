# Terminus Font
*Pixel-Perfect Monospace Typography for Terminal Interfaces*

---

## Overview
**Terminus Font** is a clean, fixed-width bitmap font designed specifically for terminal applications and programming environments. Created by [[Dimitar Zhekov]], it represents the pinnacle of [[Constraint-Based Creativity]] in typography - achieving exceptional clarity and readability within the rigid constraints of pixel grids and [[Character Cell]] display systems.

## Design Philosophy
