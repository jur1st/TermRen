# VT100
*The Reference Standard Terminal (1978)*

---

## Overview
The **VT100** (Video Terminal 100) was a computer terminal manufactured by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) from 1978-1983. It became the de facto standard for terminal interfaces, establishing conventions for [[Character Grid]] layout, [[Escape Sequences]], and terminal behavior that persist in modern computing.

## Technical Specifications
- **Display**: 80×24 [[Character Grid]]
- **Character Set**: 7-bit [[ASCII]] with graphics characters
- **Connection**: RS-232 serial interface
- **Keyboard**: Detachable, professional layout
- **Features**: [[ANSI Escape Sequences]], smooth scrolling, cursor addressing

## Historical Impact
- Established standard for [[Terminal Emulator]] behavior
- Created template for [[BBS Culture]] interfaces
- Enabled consistent [[ANSI Art]] creation across systems
- Foundation for modern terminal applications

## Cultural Significance
The VT100 represents perfect [[Constraint-Based Creativity]] - working within the limitations of 1978 technology to create an interface so elegant it remains relevant 45+ years later.

## Related Concepts
- **[[Character Grid]]**: 80×24 standard established by VT100
- **[[ANSI Escape Sequences]]**: Control codes standardized by VT100
- **[[Terminal Emulator]]**: Modern software recreating VT100 behavior
- **[[Digital Equipment Corporation]]**: Manufacturer and design philosophy

## Modern Legacy
Every modern [[Terminal Emulator]] maintains VT100 compatibility, demonstrating the enduring power of well-designed constraints.
