# Knowledge Graph Quick Start

*Understanding the Terminal Renaissance connection network*

## 🌐 What Is a Knowledge Graph?

A **knowledge graph** connects related information through links, creating a web of understanding rather than isolated documents. In this vault, every purple [[link]] represents a relationship between concepts, people, technologies, or cultural movements.

### **Why It Matters**
Traditional documents tell you **what** happened. A knowledge graph shows you **how everything connects** - the relationships, influences, and patterns that created computing's creative culture.

## 🎯 Core Concepts - Start Here

### **[[Constraint-Based Creativity]]** - The Central Thesis
*How technological limitations became creative catalysts*

**Key Examples:**
- [[ASCII]]'s 7-bit limit → Creative encoding solutions
- [[BBS Culture]]'s phone line constraint → Asynchronous communities
- [[ANSI Art]]'s 16-color palette → Artistic innovation
- [[Terminus Font]]'s pixel grid → Perfect clarity

### **[[Character Grid]]** - The Foundation
*The invisible lattice that shapes all computing interfaces*

**Connects To:**
- [[ASCII Standard]] (technical foundation)
- [[Monospace Typography]] (visual impact)
- [[Terminal Emulator]] (implementation)
- [[80-Character Line]] (physical constraint)

### **[[Terminal Renaissance]]** - The Modern Revival
*Why character-based interfaces are returning*

**Relationship Network:**
- [[Pixel Renaissance]] (aesthetic movement)
- [[Minecraft Generation]] (cultural influence)
- [[Developer Tools]] (practical adoption)
- [[AI Interfaces]] (future direction)

## 🔍 Discovery Patterns

### **Follow the Links**
Start with any concept and follow the [[links]] - each connection reveals relationships you might not expect. For example:

**[[ASCII]]** connects to:
- [[Teletype]] (hardware origin)
- [[Bob Bemer]] (key figure)
- [[7-Bit Encoding]] (technical constraint)
- [[Character Art]] (creative expression)
- [[BBS Culture]] (cultural adoption)

### **Use the Graph View**
1. Click the graph icon in the sidebar
2. Look for **dense clusters** - these are highly connected concepts
3. Find **bridge nodes** - concepts connecting different areas
4. Explore **isolated nodes** - potential areas for expansion

### **Search Strategically**
- **Broad terms**: "constraint" finds creativity patterns
- **Specific tech**: "VT100" shows hardware impact
- **Cultural terms**: "scene" reveals community connections
- **Time periods**: "1990s" shows era-specific developments

## 🎯 Success Indicators

**You're effectively using the knowledge graph when:**
- Connections surprise you with unexpected relationships
- Graph view reveals patterns you hadn't noticed
- Backlinks provide multiple perspectives on topics
- Search finds related concepts across different domains
- Timeline shows how ideas evolved and connected
- Discovery opportunities emerge from exploration
- The "big picture" becomes clearer through connections

**Remember**: The goal isn't to read everything, but to understand how everything connects. The knowledge graph makes patterns visible that would be invisible in linear text.
