## üéØ Core Thesis: Constraint-Based Creativity

Throughout computing history, **technological constraints have become creative catalysts rather than limitations**. This vault demonstrates how hardware restrictions, character limitations, and technical boundaries consistently fostered innovation, community formation, and cultural movements.

**Examples Throughout:**
- [[ASCII]]'s 7-bit limit drove creative encoding solutions
- [[BBS Culture]]'s single phone line constraint created asynchronous communities  
- [[ANSI Art]]'s 16-color palette sparked artistic innovation
- [[Solarized]]'s mathematical constraints produced optimal color relationships
- [[Terminus Font]]'s pixel grid constraints achieved perfect clarity
