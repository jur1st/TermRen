# Local vs Remote Processing Decision Matrix

*Cost/benefit framework for choosing between local Claude instances and GitHub Actions*

## Quick Decision Tree

```
START HERE
    ↓
Is this time-critical? 
    ↓ YES → Can local handle the complexity?
        ↓ YES → Use Local Swarm Mode
        ↓ NO → Request GitHub Actions approval
    ↓ NO → Continue to complexity check
        ↓
Does this require parallel processing?
    ↓ YES → Can git worktrees handle it?
        ↓ YES → Use Local Swarm Mode  
        ↓ NO → Request GitHub Actions approval
    ↓ NO → Use Local Claude
```

## Use Local Claude When

### ✅ Perfect For:
- **Research sessions** - Reading, analysis, note-taking
- **Writing tasks** - Chapter drafts, documentation
- **Code review** - Understanding existing code
- **Planning** - Creating project plans, architecture
- **Quick fixes** - Simple bug fixes, typos
- **Exploration** - Understanding codebase structure

### 📊 Metrics:
- **Setup time**: 0 minutes
- **Cost**: $0
- **Best for**: <30 minute tasks
- **Complexity**: Simple to medium

### 🎯 Example Tasks:
```
✓ "Help me understand this function"
✓ "Write a plan for implementing user auth"
✓ "Review this chapter for Feynman voice consistency"
✓ "Fix this TypeScript error"
✓ "Explain how the discovery system works"
```

---

## Use Local Swarm Mode When

### ✅ Perfect For:
- **Independent parallel tasks** - Multiple features, separate research
- **Large refactoring** - Breaking down into isolated components
- **Multi-chapter work** - Different people working on different sections
- **Research + development** - Parallel research and implementation
- **Quality assurance** - One instance writing, another reviewing

### 📊 Metrics:
- **Setup time**: 2-5 minutes (git worktree creation)
- **Cost**: $0
- **Best for**: 1-4 hour tasks
- **Complexity**: Medium to high
- **Parallel streams**: 3-4 effective maximum

### 🎯 Example Tasks:
```
✓ "Refactor authentication system while researching security best practices"
✓ "Write Chapter 5 while updating related knowledge graph nodes"
✓ "Implement feature A while testing feature B"
✓ "Research terminal history while writing about modern terminals"
```

### 🛠 Setup Requirements:
```bash
# Create worktrees for parallel work
git worktree add ../terminal-renaissance-auth auth-refactor
git worktree add ../terminal-renaissance-research research-parallel

# Launch Claude in each directory
# Terminal 1: cd ../terminal-renaissance-auth && claude
# Terminal 2: cd ../terminal-renaissance-research && claude
```

---

## Use GitHub Actions When

### ✅ Perfect For:
- **Issue automation** - Converting issues to PRs automatically
- **CI/CD integration** - Automated testing, building, deployment
- **Large-scale analysis** - Processing hundreds of files
- **Time zone coverage** - Work continuing while you sleep
- **Integration heavy** - Requires GitHub API, webhooks, etc.

### ⚠️ Requirements:
- **Approval**: Required every time
- **Cost justification**: Must document why local won't work
- **Budget availability**: Check monthly limits first
- **Monitoring**: Set up timeout and cost tracking

### 📊 Metrics:
- **Setup time**: 5-15 minutes (approval + queue)
- **Cost**: $0.03-$1.50+ per workflow
- **Best for**: Tasks requiring GitHub integration
- **Complexity**: Any (handles highest complexity)

### 🎯 Example Tasks:
```
✓ "@claude implement this feature from issue #123"
✓ Automated research triggered by PR creation
✓ Bulk migration of 500+ files
✓ Integration with external APIs during CI
✓ Cross-repository analysis and updates
```

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Local Claude
**Benefits:**
- Zero additional cost
- Immediate availability
- Full context access
- No approval needed

**Limitations:**
- Single-threaded processing
- Manual coordination required
- Limited by local resources

**Best ROI for:** Regular development work, research, planning

### Local Swarm Mode
**Benefits:**
- Zero additional cost
- Parallel processing (3-4 streams)
- Shared git history
- No approval needed

**Limitations:**
- Setup overhead (2-5 minutes)
- Manual coordination between instances
- Limited to available local terminals

**Best ROI for:** Medium complexity tasks requiring parallelization

### GitHub Actions
**Benefits:**
- Unlimited parallelization
- GitHub integration
- Automated workflows
- Runs without local attention

**Limitations:**
- Direct API costs
- Approval friction
- Queue delays
- Limited context per action

**Best ROI for:** Automation, CI/CD, large-scale processing

## Decision Framework Questions

### Cost Considerations
1. What's the monthly budget remaining?
2. Is this task worth $0.03-$1.50 in API costs?
3. Could local mode achieve 80% of the value for $0?

### Complexity Assessment
1. Can this be broken into independent parallel tasks?
2. Does this require GitHub API integration?
3. Are we processing >100 files or operations?

### Time Factors
1. Is this blocking other work?
2. Can we afford 2-5 minutes for local swarm setup?
3. Do we need this running overnight/background?

### Quality Requirements
1. Do we need automated testing integration?
2. Is manual coordination acceptable?
3. Are we creating deliverables for others?

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Research Chapter 7 color theory"
**Recommendation**: Local Claude
**Reasoning**: Single researcher, no parallel needs, cost-free

### Scenario 2: "Implement user authentication + write tests + update docs"
**Recommendation**: Local Swarm Mode (3 worktrees)
**Reasoning**: Independent parallel work, no GitHub integration needed

### Scenario 3: "Process all existing PRs for compliance with new standards"
**Recommendation**: GitHub Actions (with approval)
**Reasoning**: Requires GitHub API, bulk processing, automated workflow

### Scenario 4: "Convert issue #145 to implemented feature"
**Recommendation**: Depends on complexity
- Simple feature → Local Claude
- Complex multi-file → Local Swarm Mode  
- Requires automated testing → GitHub Actions (with approval)

## Monthly Planning

### Budget Allocation Strategy
- **70%** - Reserved for critical/time-sensitive work
- **20%** - Available for convenience/efficiency gains
- **10%** - Emergency buffer

### Usage Tracking
Keep a simple log:
```
Date | Task | Mode | Cost | Outcome | Could Local Have Worked?
2024-01-15 | Auth refactor | Local Swarm | $0 | Success | N/A
2024-01-16 | Issue #123 | GitHub Actions | $0.45 | Success | No - needed GitHub API
2024-01-17 | Research | Local | $0 | Success | N/A
```

## Red Flags: Don't Use GitHub Actions If

- [ ] Task can be done locally in same timeframe
- [ ] No GitHub integration required
- [ ] Budget is >75% consumed this month
- [ ] You haven't tried local swarm mode first
- [ ] It's just for convenience, not necessity
- [ ] You can't justify the cost clearly

*Remember: Local is the default. GitHub Actions are for when local isn't sufficient.*
