## üöÄ Quick Start for New Contributors

### 1. Read Core Principles
Start with `/writing/feynman-voice/core-principles.md` to understand the project's communication philosophy.

### 2. Review Cost Control FIRST
**MANDATORY**: Read `/api-cost-management/cost-control-protocol.md` and `/quick-reference/cost-control-checklist.md` before any work involving API calls or automation.

### 3. Review Workflow
Read `/research/workflow-process.md` to understand the research and writing process.

### 4. Choose Your Processing Method
- **Local Processing (FREE)**: Use `/local-swarm/` guides for parallel work
- **GitHub Actions (COST CONTROLLED)**: Only after approval via `/github-actions/workflow-approval-process.md`

### 5. Use Templates
All templates are in their respective directories. Copy, don't edit the originals.

### 6. Follow Checklists
Use the quality checklists AND cost control checklist before submitting any content.

## üîÑ Relationship to PROJECT-OUTPUTS

- **SYSTEM-INSTRUCTIONS**: How to do the work
- **PROJECT-OUTPUTS**: The work itself

Never mix these! Instructions stay here, outputs go in PROJECT-OUTPUTS.

## üìã Maintenance

### Adding New Instructions
- Create focused, modular files
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Include purpose and usage guidance
- **Include cost impact assessment for any automation**
- Update this README when adding new sections

### Updating Existing Instructions
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Update related files when making changes
- Test instructions with actual use cases
- **Review cost implications of any workflow changes**
- Document changes in relevant files

### Cost Control Maintenance
- Regularly review and update cost thresholds in `/api-cost-management/`
- Monitor usage patterns and adjust decision matrices
- Update local alternatives as new capabilities emerge
- Test emergency protocols in `/safety/` directory

*Remember: These instructions should help people create better content more efficiently while maintaining strict cost control. Always choose the most cost-effective method and prioritize local alternatives. Keep instructions clear, focused, and useful.*
