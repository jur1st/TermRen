## **Goal Setting Framework**
```
SMART GOAL TEMPLATE:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SPECIFIC: What exactly will I do?       │
│ MEASURABLE: How will I know I'm done?   │
│ ACHIEVABLE: Is this realistic for me?   │
│ RELEVANT: Does this advance the project?│
│ TIME-BOUND: When will I complete this?  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

EXAMPLES:
✅ Good: "Research IBM typography standards from 1970s-1980s for Technical IBM theme"
❌ Too broad: "Research IBM stuff"

✅ Good: "Organize Discovery-System files using new cleanup protocol"
❌ Too vague: "Clean up files"

✅ Good: "Write 500 words for Chapter 6 pixel renaissance section"
❌ Unrealistic: "Finish entire chapter today"
```

## **Project Scaling Decisions**
```
SCALING DECISION TREE:

Current task size?
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │ SMALL   │ ← Local Claude ($0)
    │ (1-2hr) │   Perfect for daily work
    └─────────┘
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │ MEDIUM  │ ← Local Swarm ($0)
    │ (3-8hr) │   Multiple parallel sessions
    └─────────┘
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │ LARGE   │ ← GitHub Actions ($$)
    │ (1-3dy) │   With approval + budget
    └─────────┘

COST CONSIDERATIONS:
□ Is this learning/exploration? → Local always
□ Is this creative/writing work? → Local preferred
□ Is this complex refactoring? → Local swarm
□ Does this need team coordination? → Consider remote
□ Is budget available for remote? → Check monthly limits
```

├─ Trying to do everything at once
├─ Not matching energy to task type
├─ Ignoring time constraints
├─ No clear success criteria
├─ Forgetting to prepare resources
└─ Not reviewing what actually worked

✅ EFFECTIVE PLANNING:
├─ Single daily focus that fits time/energy

├─ Energy-appropriate task selection
├─ Prepared tools and documentation

## **Planning Success Indicators**
```
GOOD PLANNING WHEN:
✅ Daily goals feel achievable and clear
✅ You know exactly what to work on first
✅ Tools and resources are prepared
✅ Time allocation matches task complexity
✅ Energy level matches task type
✅ Success criteria are obvious
✅ Next steps are planned ahead

PLANNING NEEDS WORK WHEN:
⚠️  Goals feel overwhelming or vague
⚠️  Unsure where to start working
⚠️  Resources not prepared or missing
⚠️  Time doesn't match task scope
⚠️  Energy mismatch with work type
⚠️  Unclear how to measure progress
⚠️  No plan for what comes next
```

IF PLANNING FEELS OVERWHELMING:
┌─────────────────┐

         ▼
□ Pick ONE small, achievable task
□ Set timer for 25 minutes
