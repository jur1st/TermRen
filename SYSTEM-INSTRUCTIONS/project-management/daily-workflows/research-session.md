# 🎯 Research Session Workflow Card

*Quick reference for focused research work*

## **Session Overview**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔬 RESEARCH SESSION                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ⏱️  Duration: 30-45 minutes             │
│ 💰 Cost: $0 (local tools only)         │
│ 📝 Output: Research findings & notes   │
│ 🎯 Goal: Focused exploration of topic  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## **Pre-Session Setup** (2 minutes)
```
□ Set timer for session length
□ Choose single research focus
□ Open relevant documentation
□ Create session file: research-summary-YYYYMMDD.md
□ Clear mental space for focus
```

---

## **Research Focus Areas** (pick ONE)
```
📚 CONTENT RESEARCH
   ├─ Historical facts & timeline
   ├─ Technical specifications  
   ├─ Cultural context & impact
   └─ Primary source verification

🎨 DESIGN RESEARCH  
   ├─ Visual aesthetics & styles
   ├─ Typography & color systems
   ├─ Interface design patterns
   └─ Historical design evolution

🔧 TECHNICAL RESEARCH
   ├─ Implementation methods
   ├─ Tool capabilities & limits
   ├─ System requirements
   └─ Best practices & standards

🌐 CULTURAL RESEARCH
   ├─ Community movements
   ├─ Social impact & adoption
   ├─ Key figures & contributors
   └─ Cross-cultural connections
```

---

## **Research Process** (25-40 minutes)
```
EXPLORATION PHASE:
□ Use local search tools (Grep, Glob, Read)
□ Follow interesting connections
□ Document findings in session file
□ Note questions that arise

VERIFICATION PHASE:
□ Cross-reference multiple sources
□ Check historical accuracy
□ Verify technical details
□ Look for contradictions

SYNTHESIS PHASE:
□ Summarize key findings
□ Identify patterns & themes
□ Connect to existing knowledge
□ Note implications for project
```

---

## **Discovery Management**
```
WHEN YOU FIND TANGENTS:
┌─────────────────┐
│ INTERESTING BUT │
│ OFF-TOPIC?      │
└─────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
□ Note in appropriate discovery file:
   ├─ future-research-ideas.md
   ├─ tangential-themes.md  
   ├─ research-rabbit-holes.md
   └─ terminal-preservation-tracking.md

□ Return to session focus
□ Don't lose momentum chasing tangents
```

---

## **Session Wrap-Up** (3-5 minutes)
```
DOCUMENT & ORGANIZE:
□ Complete session summary
□ Update ACCUMULATED-KNOWLEDGE.md if needed
□ File discovery items appropriately
□ Clean up any temporary files

PLAN NEXT STEPS:
□ Note follow-up questions
□ Identify next research priorities
□ Update project todo list
□ Set next session focus
```

---

## **Quality Indicators**
```
✅ SUCCESSFUL SESSION:
   ├─ Single topic explored deeply
   ├─ Clear findings documented
   ├─ Sources verified & noted
   ├─ Connections to project identified
   ├─ Discovery items captured
   └─ Next steps planned

⚠️  NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:
   ├─ Jumped between topics
   ├─ Findings unclear or incomplete
   ├─ Sources not verified
   ├─ No clear project connections
   ├─ Tangents not captured
   └─ No plan for continuation
```

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
```
❌ Research paralysis (too broad)
❌ Source verification skipping
❌ Tangent following without noting
❌ No clear session boundaries
❌ Forgetting to document process
❌ Not connecting to project goals
```

---

## **Emergency Session Rescue**
```
IF SESSION GOES OFF-TRACK:
┌─────────────────┐
│ PAUSE & RESET   │
└─────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
□ Check timer - how much time left?
□ Return to original session focus
□ Note current findings quickly
□ Either refocus or wrap up cleanly
□ Don't extend beyond time limit
```
