# 🧹 Cleanup Protocol Workflow Card

*End every session with organized files and clear next steps*

## **Protocol Overview**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🧹 CLEANUP PROTOCOL                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ⏱️  Duration: 5-10 minutes              │
│ 💰 Cost: $0 (organization only)        │
│ 📝 Output: Organized project state     │
│ 🎯 Goal: Ready for next session        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

   Quick          Decision         Git
  Scanning        Matrix          Ready
```

---

## **Step 1: Quick File Scan** (2 minutes)
```
VISUAL SCAN OF DISCOVERY-SYSTEM:
□ What new files appeared?
□ What files grew significantly?
□ What temporary files exist?
□ What outputs were generated?

FILE TYPE IDENTIFICATION:
□ Research notes (.md files)
□ Generated outputs (conversion files)
□ Scripts & tools (.sh, .css files)
□ Session reports & summaries
□ Templates & samples
```

---

## **Step 2: Decision Matrix** (3-5 minutes)
```
FOR EACH FILE, ASK:

┌─ KEEP IN DISCOVERY-SYSTEM ─────┐
│ □ Active working document      │
│ □ Current session notes        │
│ □ Future research tracking     │
│ □ User guides & references     │
│ □ Templates for reuse          │
└────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ MOVE TO PERMANENT HOME ───────┐
│ □ Completed research findings  │
│ □ Production tools & scripts   │
│ □ Generated sample outputs     │
│ □ Session reports & summaries  │
│ □ Historical research archive  │
└────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ ARCHIVE OR DELETE ────────────┐
│ □ Temporary test files         │
│ □ Duplicate outputs            │
│ □ Failed experiments           │
│ □ Outdated versions            │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## **Step 3: File Organization** (2-3 minutes)
```
PERMANENT HOMES FOR FILE TYPES:

📁 03-Research-Infrastructure/
├─ Implementation/          ← Production tools & scripts
├─ Testing-Results/         ← Quality & compatibility reports  
├─ Session-Reports/         ← AI analysis & execution summaries
├─ Research-Archive/        ← Historical research by topic
├─ Generated-Samples/       ← Conversion outputs & test files
└─ Discovery-System/        ← Active working documents only

QUICK MOVE COMMANDS:
□ mv [production-files] ../Implementation/
□ mv [test-results] ../Testing-Results/
□ mv [session-reports] ../Session-Reports/
□ mv [research-files] ../Research-Archive/[topic]/
□ mv [generated-outputs] ../Generated-Samples/
```

---

## **Step 4: Discovery File Updates** (1-2 minutes)
```
UPDATE DISCOVERY TRACKING:
□ future-research-ideas.md
   └─ Add any new research topics discovered

□ tangential-themes.md  
   └─ Note interesting patterns found

□ research-rabbit-holes.md
   └─ Log tangents avoided for future

□ terminal-preservation-tracking.md
   └─ Add software/hardware needing preservation
```

---

## **Step 5: Session Documentation** (1 minute)
```
CREATE SESSION SUMMARY:
□ File: CLEANUP-SESSION-SUMMARY-YYYYMMDD.md
□ Document: What was moved where and why
□ Note: Key achievements & outputs
□ Record: Files preserved vs archived
□ Plan: Next session focus areas
```

---

## **Quality Checks**
```
✅ CLEANUP COMPLETE WHEN:
├─ Discovery-System contains only active files
├─ All completed work moved to permanent homes
├─ Discovery files updated with new findings
├─ Session summary documents organization
├─ Project ready for next session
└─ No orphaned or misplaced files

⚠️  NEEDS ATTENTION:
├─ Discovery-System cluttered with outputs
├─ Valuable work not preserved
├─ Discovery tracking not updated
├─ No record of what was accomplished
├─ Unclear what to work on next
```

## **Cleanup Decision Tree**
```ascii
CLEANUP DECISION FLOW

File found in Discovery-System
         │
         ▼
    Is it active work? ─── YES ─── Keep in Discovery-System
         │
         NO
         │
         ▼
    Completed research? ─── YES ─── Move to Research-Archive/
         │
         NO
         │
         ▼
    Production tool? ─── YES ─── Move to Implementation/
         │
         NO  
         │
         ▼
    Test/sample output? ─── YES ─── Move to Generated-Samples/
         │
         NO
         │
         ▼
    Session report? ─── YES ─── Move to Session-Reports/
         │
         NO
         │
         ▼
    Temporary/failed? ─── YES ─── Archive or delete
```

## **Common Organization Patterns**
```
AFTER RESEARCH SESSION:
├─ Research notes → Research-Archive/[topic]/
├─ Discovery items → Update tracking files
├─ Session summary → Current location record
└─ Next steps → Plan next session

AFTER CODING SESSION:
├─ Scripts & tools → Implementation/
├─ Test results → Testing-Results/
├─ Generated samples → Generated-Samples/
├─ Implementation notes → Research-Archive/
└─ Session report → Session-Reports/

AFTER WRITING SESSION:
├─ Draft content → 01-Chapters/ or content area
├─ Research notes → Research-Archive/
├─ Style guides → SYSTEM-INSTRUCTIONS/writing/
├─ Templates → Appropriate template directory
└─ Session notes → Session-Reports/
```

## **Emergency Quick Cleanup**
```
IF SHORT ON TIME (2 minutes max):
┌─────────────────┐
│ RAPID SORT      │
└─────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
□ Create temp folder: discovery-system-cleanup-YYYYMMDD/
□ Move all new files there
□ Add note: "Need to organize - see cleanup protocol"
□ Commit current state with note
□ Plan dedicated cleanup session
```

---

## **Success Metrics**
```
ORGANIZED SESSION WHEN:
✅ Can find any file quickly
✅ Discovery-System ready for new work  
✅ All valuable research preserved
✅ Clear record of accomplishments
✅ Next session focus identified
✅ Project feels manageable & clear
```
