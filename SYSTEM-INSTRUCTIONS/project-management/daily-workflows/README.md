## 🌊 **Typical Work Flows**

### **Complete Session Cycle**
```
1. 📋 Planning (15 min)
   ├─ Review yesterday's progress
   ├─ Choose today's focus
   ├─ Set realistic goals
   └─ Prepare resources

2. 🔬 Research/Work (30-45 min)
   ├─ Focused deep work
   ├─ Document as you go
   ├─ Manage tangents
   └─ Track discoveries

3. 🧹 Cleanup (5-10 min)
   ├─ Organize files
   ├─ Move completed work
   ├─ Update discovery tracking
   └─ Document session

4. 🔄 Git Commit (5 min)
   ├─ Review changes
   ├─ Stage files logically
   ├─ Write clear message
   └─ Preserve work safely
```

### **Quick Daily Patterns**
```
MORNING FRESH START:
□ Planning → Research → Cleanup → Commit

AFTERNOON CONTINUATION:
□ Quick planning → Research → Cleanup → Commit

EVENING WRAP-UP:
□ Cleanup → Commit → Plan tomorrow

TIME-LIMITED SESSION:
□ Quick planning → Short research → Essential cleanup → Commit
```

## 🎨 **Workflow Customization**

### **Energy-Based Selection**
```
HIGH ENERGY DAYS:
├─ Longer planning sessions (30 min)
├─ Creative research work (45-60 min)
├─ System building & improvements
└─ Complex problem solving

MEDIUM ENERGY DAYS:
├─ Standard planning (15 min)
├─ Focused research (30-45 min)

└─ File organization

LOW ENERGY DAYS:
├─ Minimal planning (5 min)
├─ Light research or reading (20-30 min)
├─ Simple cleanup tasks
└─ Administrative work
```

### **Time-Based Adaptation**
```
FULL SESSION (90+ minutes):
□ Planning → Multiple research cycles → Cleanup → Commit

STANDARD SESSION (60 minutes):
□ Planning → Single research cycle → Cleanup → Commit

SHORT SESSION (30 minutes):
□ Quick planning → Focused work → Essential cleanup → Commit

MICRO SESSION (15 minutes):
□ Single workflow card focus only
```

PROBLEM: Workflows don't match your style
SOLUTION: Customize cards, create your own variations

PROBLEM: Too many choices, analysis paralysis
SOLUTION: Start with Research → Cleanup → Git cycle
```
