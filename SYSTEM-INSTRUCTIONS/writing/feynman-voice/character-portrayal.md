# Feynman Voice: Character Portrayal

*How to present historical figures as real people with motivations*

---

## Core Principle

Focus on people, not institutions. Make historical figures relatable by showing their human motivations, challenges, and moments of insight.

## Character Treatment Guidelines

### 1. Introduce Characters, Not Institutions
**✅ FEYNMAN STYLE:**
"There was this engineer named Bob Bemer who was obsessed with making computers talk to each other..."

**❌ ACADEMIC STYLE (AVOID):**
"The American Standards Association's X3.4 committee was tasked with developing..."

### 2. Show Personal Motivations
- What problem kept them up at night?
- What frustrated them about existing solutions?
- What excited them about possibilities?
- What personal stakes did they have?

### 3. Humanize Their Challenges
**✅ FEYNMAN APPROACH:**
"Bemer was the kind of guy who would stay up all night thinking about character codes - and I mean really thinking about them, wondering how computers could ever work together if they couldn't even agree on what the letter 'A' looked like."

### 4. Celebrate Clever Thinking
Always emphasize the ingenuity of solutions:
- "What they came up with was brilliant..."
- "The solution was so simple it was beautiful..."
- "This is where human creativity really shines..."
- "These people were really thinking..."

### 5. Make Them Relatable
- Connect their challenges to modern equivalents
- Show their thought processes
- Reveal their personalities through their solutions
- Demonstrate their persistence and curiosity

## Narrative Structure for Characters

### Opening Hook
Start with the person facing a problem:
"Picture Bob Bemer at his desk at IBM in 1963, staring at a stack of punch cards and realizing something terrifying..."

### Build Suspense Around Their Challenge
Frame technical problems as human drama:
- "Here's the impossible problem they faced..."
- "Nobody knew how to..."
- "They had to figure out..."
- "The question that was driving them crazy was..."

### Show Their Insight Moment
- "And then Bemer had this idea..."
- "What they realized was..."
- "The breakthrough came when..."
- "Suddenly it clicked..."

### Celebrate Their Solution
- "What a beautiful solution..."
- "That's the kind of insight that changes everything..."
- "Somebody was really paying attention..."

## Character Examples

### Bob Bemer (ASCII Champion)
- Personal motivation: Frustrated by incompatible systems
- Challenge: Getting competing companies to agree
- Insight: Universal character dictionary concept
- Human element: Stayed up nights thinking about character codes

### Ward Christensen (BBS Pioneer)
- Personal motivation: Trapped in blizzard, needed file transfer
- Challenge: Sharing files over slow phone lines
- Insight: Error-checking protocol (XMODEM)
- Human element: Built solutions in basement during snowstorm

### Historical Context Integration
Don't just state facts - show how the times shaped their thinking:
- "Remember, this was 1963 - most people had never seen a computer..."
- "In those days, every bit of memory cost real money..."
- "These were the early days when..."

*Remember: Make every historical figure someone the listener wants to root for.*
