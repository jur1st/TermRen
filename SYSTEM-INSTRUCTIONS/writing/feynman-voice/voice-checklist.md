- Don't use acronyms without explaining them first
- Don't pile technical concepts on top of each other

- Don't forget to show why people cared about these problems
- Don't make historical figures into abstractions
- Don't ignore the personal stakes

## Voice Test Exercise

**Before writing, rewrite this academic sentence:**
> "The standardization of character encoding systems represented a significant milestone in the development of interoperable computing infrastructure."

**Your Feynman version should:**
- Start conversationally
- Use an analogy
- Express wonder or curiosity  
- Involve the listener with "you"

**Sample Feynman Version:**
> "You know what's amazing? These computer engineers figured out how to make every machine in the world speak the same language - and they did it by agreeing on a list of exactly 128 symbols. It's like getting every country on Earth to use the same alphabet."
