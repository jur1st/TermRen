# Research and Writing Workflow - Terminal Renaissance Project

*This document outlines the improved research and writing process that integrates the Discovery System and prioritizes simple, effective information capture.*

---

## Overview

This workflow balances three goals:
1. Capturing information needed for immediate writing tasks
2. Preserving tangential discoveries for future research
3. **Maintaining cost control** throughout the research process

The system prioritizes cost-effective local tools and simple text files - no expensive automation or complex code needed.

## üö® Cost Control Framework

### Research Processing Options (Choose Wisely)

**üü¢ PREFERRED: Local Claude Sessions ($0 additional cost)**
- Standard research and writing work
- Interactive discovery and analysis
- Part of personal subscription - no extra charges

**üü° COST-EFFECTIVE: Local Swarm Mode ($0 additional cost)**
- Parallel research using git worktrees
- Multiple Claude instances for complex projects
- No GitHub Actions or automation costs
- Setup guide: `local-swarm/git-worktree-setup.md`

**üî¥ EXPENSIVE: GitHub Actions (Requires Pre-Approval)**
- Automated research workflows: $1.50-$5.00+ per execution
- @claude interactions: $0.03-$1.50+ each
- **MANDATORY**: Explicit approval required before setup
- Approval process: `github-actions/workflow-approval-process.md`

### Pre-Research Cost Assessment
Before starting any research session:
- [ ] Budget status verified (check monthly spending)
- [ ] Local alternatives considered first
- [ ] If automation needed, approval obtained
- [ ] Cost tracking method prepared

---

## Research Session Workflow

### 1. Session Setup (2-3 minutes)
```bash
# Create new research summary file
cp RESEARCH-SUMMARY-TEMPLATE.md RESEARCH-SUMMARY-$(date +%Y%m%d).md

# Add cost tracking header
echo "## Cost Tracking - $(date)" >> RESEARCH-SUMMARY-$(date +%Y%m%d).md
echo "Processing Mode: [Local Claude / Local Swarm / GitHub Actions]" >> RESEARCH-SUMMARY-$(date +%Y%m%d).md
echo "Budget Status: [OK / Warning / Critical]" >> RESEARCH-SUMMARY-$(date +%Y%m%d).md
echo "Estimated Session Cost: $0 (local) | $XX.XX (if using automation)" >> RESEARCH-SUMMARY-$(date +%Y%m%d).md
echo "" >> RESEARCH-SUMMARY-$(date +%Y%m%d).md
```

### 2. Active Research Phase (30-45 minute blocks)
- Read source materials thoroughly
- Take notes directly in your research summary file
- Focus on information relevant to current writing task
- **Cost Checkpoint**: Verify still using local tools only
- After each block: **Pause for Discovery Check**

### 3. Discovery Check Protocol (2 minutes per discovery)
Ask yourself: "What interesting things did I find that aren't directly relevant?"

For each tangential discovery:
1. Rate relevance to current task (0-10 scale)
2. **Rate cost impact**: Low (local research) / Medium (might need tools) / High (requires automation)
3. If score <7, quickly note:
   - What is it?
   - Why is it interesting?
   - Which discovery file should it go in?
   - Cost-effective approach for future investigation
4. Add to "Discoveries Logged" section of your summary

### 4. Session Wrap-up (5-10 minutes)
- Review and clean up session notes
- **Update cost tracking**: Record actual costs vs estimates
- Add key findings to ACCUMULATED-KNOWLEDGE.md
- Process logged discoveries:

```bash
# Example: Adding a discovery about font history
echo "## Historical Font Pricing - $(date)" >> future-research-ideas.md
echo "Discovery: Early terminal fonts were licensed for $1000s per site" >> future-research-ideas.md
echo "Significance: Shows how font IP shaped terminal evolution" >> future-research-ideas.md
echo "" >> future-research-ideas.md
```

### 5. Weekly Review (Fridays, 30 minutes)
- Review all research summaries from the week
- **Analyze cost patterns**: Track local vs automated tool usage
- Consolidate discoveries across sessions
- **Evaluate cost-effectiveness**: Identify high-value, low-cost research areas
- Update ACCUMULATED-KNOWLEDGE.md with major findings
- Plan next week's research priorities with cost considerations

---

## GitHub Actions Integration (COST CONTROLLED)

### When GitHub Actions Might Be Justified
‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember**: All GitHub Actions require explicit pre-approval and incur significant costs.

**Potential Use Cases** (after approval):
- Automated research triggered by external events (PRs, issues)
- Large-scale content processing that exceeds local capacity
- Scheduled research automation for time-sensitive topics
- Cross-repository analysis requiring GitHub API integration

### GitHub Actions Research Workflow
If approved for GitHub Actions usage:

1. **Pre-Execution Cost Verification**
   - Confirm approval documentation exists
   - Verify budget allocation and limits
   - Set up cost monitoring and alerts
   - Prepare emergency shutdown procedures

2. **Execution Monitoring**
   - Track costs in real-time during execution
   - Monitor for scope creep or unexpected complexity
   - Document actual vs estimated costs
   - Maintain emergency shutdown readiness

3. **Post-Execution Review**
   - Calculate total costs (API + compute)
   - Analyze cost-effectiveness vs local alternatives
   - Update cost estimation models for future
   - Document lessons learned for cost optimization

### Emergency Cost Control During Automated Research
```bash
# Emergency shutdown commands (if costs spiral)
gh run list --status in_progress --json databaseId --jq '.[].databaseId' | xargs -I {} gh run cancel {}
gh workflow disable claude-research-automation.yml
gh workflow disable claude-pr-assistant.yml
```

## File Management

### Active Files
1. **RESEARCH-SUMMARY-[DATE].md** - Daily session notes
2. **ACCUMULATED-KNOWLEDGE.md** - Growing knowledge base
3. **Discovery System Files** - Tangential findings

### Simple Bash Commands for File Management
```bash
# List recent research summaries
ls -la RESEARCH-SUMMARY-*.md | tail -10

# Search for a concept across all summaries
grep -i "ascii" RESEARCH-SUMMARY-*.md

# Count discoveries logged this week
grep -c "Discoveries Logged" RESEARCH-SUMMARY-*.md

# Combine multiple summaries for review
cat RESEARCH-SUMMARY-2025*.md > weekly-review.md
```

## Discovery System Integration

### When to Log a Discovery
- You find something fascinating but off-topic
- You notice a pattern worth investigating later
- You discover a resource needing preservation
- You identify a cross-disciplinary connection

### Where to Log Discoveries
- **future-research-ideas.md** - New research projects
- **terminal-preservation-tracking.md** - Software/hardware needing preservation
- **tangential-themes.md** - Interesting patterns and connections
- **research-rabbit-holes.md** - Deep dives avoided during current work

### How to Log Discoveries (No Code Required)
Use simple echo commands or manually edit during review:
```bash
# Quick discovery logging
echo "$(date): Found reference to lost DEC terminal manual - check archive.org" >> terminal-preservation-tracking.md
```

---

## Information Extraction Guidelines

### What to Extract
‚úÖ **DO Extract:**
- Direct quotes that perfectly explain concepts
- Specific dates, names, technical specifications
- Compelling stories or anecdotes
- Surprising facts or counterintuitive findings
- Clear technical explanations

‚ùå **DON'T Extract:**
- General background information
- Information easily found again
- Entire sections "just in case"
- Redundant explanations of same concept

### How to Reference
Keep references simple and findable:
```
"The 7-bit decision saved memory but limited international use"
Source: ASCII-History.pdf:page42
```

---

## Writing Preparation

### Before Writing a Section
1. Review relevant parts of ACCUMULATED-KNOWLEDGE.md
2. Gather related research summaries
3. Create simple outline with key points
4. Identify which quotes/facts you'll actually use

### During Writing
- Keep research summaries open for reference
- Add new discoveries to session summary as you write
- Mark used quotes in your summaries to avoid repetition

---

## Quality Checks

### End of Each Session
- [ ] Main findings clearly summarized?
- [ ] Sources properly noted?
- [ ] Discoveries logged (if any)?
- [ ] Key items added to accumulated knowledge?
- [ ] **Cost tracking updated**: Actual vs estimated costs recorded?
- [ ] **Local tools used**: No unauthorized automation triggered?

### Weekly Review
- [ ] All sessions have summaries?
- [ ] Discoveries processed and filed?
- [ ] Accumulated knowledge updated?
- [ ] Next week's priorities identified?
- [ ] **Cost analysis completed**: Weekly spending vs budget reviewed?
- [ ] **Cost-effective discoveries prioritized**: High-value, low-cost research identified?

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-organizing**: Don't create elaborate filing systems
2. **Over-extracting**: Only save what you'll actually use
3. **Under-discovering**: Don't lose interesting tangents
4. **Complex solutions**: Use bash commands, not custom scripts
5. **Delayed processing**: Process discoveries same day
6. **üö® Cost blindness**: Forgetting to track costs and tool usage
7. **üö® Automation temptation**: Using GitHub Actions without approval for convenience
8. **üö® Scope creep**: Expanding automated tasks beyond approved budgets

---

## Success Metrics

You're using the system well if:
- You can find information quickly when writing
- Interesting tangents are preserved, not lost
- Research builds systematically over time
- Other team members can understand your notes
- You spend more time researching than organizing
- **Cost control is maintained**: Staying within budget while maximizing research value
- **Local tools are prioritized**: Using cost-free alternatives before expensive automation
