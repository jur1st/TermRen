## üé≠ Character Voices and Treatment

### Bob Bemer
- Portray with deep respect and admiration
- Emphasize his vision and persistence
- Show him as someone who saw the big picture
- Voice should convey "this guy was really thinking"

### The ASCII Committee
- Make them feel like real people, not abstract institutions
- Show the human drama of technical decision-making
- Emphasize the pressure and stakes they faced
- Convey the satisfaction of collaborative problem-solving

### IBM/Corporate Characters
- Neutral but show the business tensions
- Don't vilify corporate decisions - show their logic
- Emphasize the human elements in business decisions

---

## üéØ Technical Concept Guidelines

### Character Encoding/ASCII
- Start simple, build complexity gradually
- Use the "universal dictionary" metaphor consistently
- Emphasize the elegance of the 7-bit solution
- Show appreciation for the bit arrangement cleverness

### The Character Grid
- Make the invisible visible through description
- Use spatial language to help listeners visualize
- Connect to everyday experiences (parking lots, waffle irons)
- Emphasize how constraints became culture

### Monospace Typography
- Help listeners understand why every character needs the same space
- Connect to programming readability
- Show how technical necessity became aesthetic preference

## üé® Emphasis and Pacing Guidelines

### Questions and Engagement
Emphasize questions that engage the listener:
- "You know what's interesting about..."
- "But here's the thing..."
- "Now, you might think..."
- "Picture this..."

### Technical Explanations
- Slower pace for complex concepts
- Pause after key insights to let them sink in
- Build understanding step by step
- Return to analogies for clarity

### Moments of Wonder
Highlight moments of appreciation:
- "What these people figured out was incredible..."
- "Here's the amazing part..."
- "This is where it gets really beautiful..."
- "The elegance of this solution..."

### Transitions
Use natural, conversational transitions:
- "So that's one piece of the puzzle..."
- "Now, with that in mind..."
- "Here's where things get interesting..."
- "But I'm getting ahead of myself..."
