    for line in grid_lines:
        expected_position = calculate_expected_position(line)
        actual_position = measure_actual_position(line)
        deviation = abs(expected_position - actual_position)
        deviations.append(deviation)
    
    return {
        'mean_deviation': statistics.mean(deviations),
        'max_deviation': max(deviations),

    """Measure actual character widths in terminal display"""
    measurements = {}
    
    for character in text_sample:
        # Measure width using multiple methods
        logical_width = get_logical_width(character)
        visual_width = measure_visual_width(character, font_name)
        wcwidth_result = wcwidth(character)
        
        measurements[character] = {
            'logical': logical_width,
            'visual': visual_width,

    std_dev = statistics.stdev(measurements)
    n = len(measurements)
    
    # 95% confidence interval
    margin_of_error = 1.96 * (std_dev / math.sqrt(n))
    
    return {
        'mean': mean_alignment,
        'confidence_interval': (
            mean_alignment - margin_of_error,
            mean_alignment + margin_of_error
