# ⚠️ EXTREME COST WARNING ⚠️
# This workflow can incur VERY HIGH COSTS ($1.50-$5.00+ per execution)
# PARALLEL MODE can multiply costs by 3x or more
# USAGE ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES EXPLICIT PRE-APPROVAL
# See SYSTEM-INSTRUCTIONS/github-actions/workflow-approval-process.md
# EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN: gh workflow disable claude-research-automation.yml
# LOCAL ALTERNATIVE STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: Use local swarm mode (git worktrees)
