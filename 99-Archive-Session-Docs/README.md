# Session Documentation Archive

This directory contains temporary work and session documentation for the Terminal Renaissance project.

## Structure

Session directories follow this naming convention:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-session-{purpose}/
```

Example:
- `2024-12-20-session-github-setup/`
- `2024-12-21-session-chapter5-research/`
- `2024-12-22-session-knowledge-graph-update/`

## Purpose

1. **Temporary Work Storage**: All temporary files created during work sessions
2. **Planning Documentation**: Session plans and progress tracking
3. **Research Notes**: Interim findings before integration into main documents
4. **Cleanup Tracking**: Records of what was preserved and why

## Cleanup Protocol

At the end of each session:
1. Review all created files
2. Move necessary files to permanent locations
3. Delete unnecessary temporary files
4. Document decisions in `session-notes.md`

## Important Notes

- This directory is for **temporary work only**
- Permanent contributions should be moved to appropriate project directories
- Old sessions may be periodically archived or removed
- Always prefer editing existing project files over creating new temporary ones
