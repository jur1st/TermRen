## People

### Bob Bemer (IBM)
- Engineer who championed ASCII standardization while IBM developed competing EBCDIC
- Known for staying up all night thinking about character encoding problems

### Ward Christensen
- Co-inventor of XMODEM protocol and creator of first BBS (CBBS) in 1978
- Built solutions in his Chicago basement during blizzard of 1978

### John Auwaerter (Teletype Corporation)  
- Led the X3.4 committee that created ASCII standard
- Managed the complex process of getting competing companies to agree on character codes

## Events

### ASCII Standardization (1963-1968)
- X3.4 committee spent 2 years developing 7-bit encoding standard
- President Johnson's 1968 mandate required ASCII for government computers

### The Blizzard of 1978
- Chicago snowstorm that trapped Ward Christensen at home
- Led to creation of XMODEM and first BBS during forced isolation

## Technical Concepts

### Character Cells
- Fixed-size grid (typically 7x9 dots) for displaying characters on terminals
- Created monospace typography as engineering necessity, not design choice

### 7-bit vs 8-bit Decision
- ASCII used 7 bits (128 characters) to leave 8th bit for parity checking
- Memory was expensive ($1000s per kilobyte) making every bit precious

### ANSI Escape Sequences
- Control codes that allowed color, cursor movement, and formatting
- Enabled rich TUIs despite character-based limitations

## Good Quotes

### On Constraints and Creativity
- "When you're forced to work within limitations, you discover possibilities you never would have found in an unconstrained system"

### On Early Computing Culture
- "These weren't just technical preferences; they were cultural markers"
- Source: Chapter-01-The-Secret-Grid.md:70
