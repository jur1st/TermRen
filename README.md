## üéØ Core Thesis: Constraint-Based Creativity

**Technological constraints become creative catalysts rather than limitations.**

Throughout computing history, hardware restrictions and technical boundaries consistently fostered innovation, community formation, and cultural movements:

- **ASCII's 7-bit limit** ‚Üí Creative encoding solutions & art forms
- **BBS phone line constraints** ‚Üí Asynchronous community formation  
- **16-color terminal palettes** ‚Üí Sophisticated artistic techniques
- **Monospace typography limits** ‚Üí Mathematical precision in font design
- **Character grid boundaries** ‚Üí Entire art movements (ANSI art)
